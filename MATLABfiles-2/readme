Log for assignment 1

When choosing values for q, r and the rest of the parameters we started with values from the Individual EKF-PDAs part that gave good results. From this starting point we tried to find values for ANEES (pos and vel) that was inside the chi-squared boundary. We found values that was inside this boundary and that gave a good tracking result.
